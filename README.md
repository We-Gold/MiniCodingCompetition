## Overview

Picking a CS program is difficult. Also, it is usually done by making a big excel spreadsheet and looking at a bunch of numbers

That's why this project is an intuitive, easy to use dashboard where users can view various CS programs and statistics about them

An easy to use GUI makes comparing colleges easier

This includes data on number of papers published, quality of papers, and how many PhD students return to become professors

More data points can be added in the future.
